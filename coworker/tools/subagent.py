"""The `explore` tool — a read-only research subagent with its own context window.

Broad questions ("where is retry logic handled?") burn the main session's context on
dozens of file reads. `explore` spawns a child TurnEngine over the same workspace with
read-only tools and a fresh context; only its final report returns to the caller.

The child runs in plan mode — the PermissionEngine hard-blocks writes/shell no matter
what the child decides — with no approver, so it never needs an approval round-trip.
That's what lets `explore` carry low-risk metadata, which in turn makes several explores
in one assistant turn eligible for the engine's parallel execution. No recursion: the
child registry has no `explore` tool.
